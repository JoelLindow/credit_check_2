# credit_check_using_inbound_integer

This is my 3rd version of Credit Check.

I was looking to add another layer of challenge to this exercise. In previous versions I have written using the input of a String of numbers. This time I wanted to use an actual FixedNum, as it requires many more conversions of digits from integer to string and back to integer again.

Some of the code is slightly bulky, but you will also notice an effort to alleviate the bulk through the use of multiple "helper methods".

I enjoyed the chance to revisit this exercise one more time and really lock in some concepts by approaching the input date from a totally different angle.

# credit_check_using_inbound_string

This is my 4th version of Credit Check.

This problem is approached in the traditional fashion of processing an inbound "string". Multiple helper methods are used for various stages of conversion and validation throughout the app.

By the end of the application this program will accurately validate credit card numbers using the Luhn Algorithm.
